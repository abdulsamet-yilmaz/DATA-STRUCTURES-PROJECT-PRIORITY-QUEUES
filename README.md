Ranking Documents for Information Retrieval with Priority Queues

In this project, I used min-heap to implement a priority queue for the
task of ranking documents. My aim was to rank the documents in the folder according to 
entered keyword by the user using binomial heaps and extract the most relevant documents
according to keyword from the folder.
